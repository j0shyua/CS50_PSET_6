##Week 8
2 weeks of introduction to machine learning and python. Week 8 discussed the several functions of python, and how to do previous c-programs in Python. Also introduced to the world of web-based programming, and how to create a basic web server/application.

##Problem Set 6 (2017)
Port various programs created in C from weeks before into python. Additionally, for "sentiments," create a program that analyzes the "sentiment" or positivity/negativity of a word/phrase. For the program "smile.py" analyze a word/phrase inputted in the terminal. "Tweets.py" analyzes the 50 most recent tweets of a user given in the terminal. The web application allows a user to search for twitter handles, and displays a pie chart of the sentiment of that user's past 100 tweets.

Note: Some programs require the "cs50" module to be imported. List of other required modules are in sentiments/requirements.txt
